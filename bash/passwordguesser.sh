# This script demonstrates testing to see if 2 strings are the same
# it also demonstrates using conditional execution

# TASK 1: Improve it by asking the user for a password guess instead of using inline literal data (i.e. TestString)
# TASK 2: Improve it by rewriting it to use the if command
#         The if command should test if they got it right, in which case it should tell them they got it right
#         The if command should tell them they got it wrong
# TASK 3: Improve it by giving them 5 tries to get it right before failing
#           *** Do not use the exit command, and do not use a loop (e.g. while or for)

#Task 1
mypassword="rahul"
echo "Enter your five digit password to continue"
read enteredpassword

#Task2 and task 3
